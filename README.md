I've bootstrapped react projects both using 'create-react-app' as well as the plain and not-so-simple Webpack and Babel.

While Facebook's 'create-react-app' is heavy on the initial installation and the overall packages, setting up with webpack demands heavy focus on the setup.

Hence,

# React + Vite
Quick and Lite!


# IMPORTANT:

- Follow https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation to setup tailwindcss.
- Install Tailwind CSS Intellisense VS Code extension for suggestions and auto-complete.
- Install Prettier VS Code extension for code formatting.
- # Add .prettierrc file and add "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"].
- # Add package 'prettier' and 'prettier-plugin-tailwindcss' for tailwindcss class auto ordering.
