## Setup
In the past, I've bootstrapped react projects both using 'create-react-app' as well as the plain and not-so-simple Webpack and Babel in the past.

While Facebook's 'create-react-app' is heavy on the initial installation and the overall package, setting up with webpack demands heavy attention and time during the setup process.
<br /><br />

Hence,
### React + Vite <br />
Quick and Lite!
<br /><br />

### IMPORTANT:

- Follow https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation to setup tailwindcss.
- Install Tailwind CSS Intellisense VS Code extension for suggestions and auto-complete.
- Install Prettier VS Code extension for code formatting.
- **Add .prettierrc file and add "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"].**
- **Add package 'prettier' and 'prettier-plugin-tailwindcss' for tailwindcss class auto ordering.**
